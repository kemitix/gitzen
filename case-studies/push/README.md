# Case Study: Push

Test scripts to explore how the rebasing and cherry-picking works.

The script will create a new git repo and build up a tree, then attempt to
perform a series of updates to simulate the planned gitzen update and push
processes.

```bash
./run.sh
```

Note: this doesn't cover the cases where commits are reordered or dropped.
